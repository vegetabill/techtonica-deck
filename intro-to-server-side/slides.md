# Engineer Hierarchy

## [Is Front End a bad career path?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lxwja/is_front_end_a_bad_career_path/)

I've been doing mostly UI-related CRUD front end work for the past 1.5 years with React.js, Node.js, and some Sass/CSS, and make $110k in NYC. Honestly I'm pretty bored of Javascript, the front end scene in general, and **absolutely hate CSS**, but it feels like I've now pigeonholed myself as a front end guy.
